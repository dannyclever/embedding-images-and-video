        How do you contribute to open source? In this video, I'll describe the
        easiest way to make a simple contribution to an open source project --
        without using the command line, a text editor, "forking a repo", or even
        touching Git outside of Github. I'll also describe what kinds of
        contributions open

          I am working through the Odin Project which is good but it took me
          ages to figure out how to submit my solution to the HTML/CSS project.I
          posted in all places (on the Odin website, on Google+ and others) and
          I finally got a reply (thanks hgducherne). However I'm still waiting
          for the repo admin to accept my pull request, so this has been a slow,
          tedious process as my first introduction to contributing on GitHub.
          Shame I didn't see this video earlier and I hope my pull request is
          dealt with
