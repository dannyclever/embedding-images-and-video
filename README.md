# embedding-images-and-video
Microverse 1st project
This is our first Microverse project so we built the Youtube's page.
The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.To style de page we use only CSS FlexBox.
